          <h3>What Is Nigiri Sushi?</h3>
          <p>
            Nigiri sushi is that familiar style of sushi made up of an
            oval-shaped mound of rice with a slice of (usually) raw fish on top.
            The word nigiri comes from the Japanese nigirizushi, which
            translates as "hand-pressed sushi." Thus nigiri is a type of sushi
            where the rice is molded by hand and the fish or other topping
            pressed by hand atop the rice. And it's the stickiness of the rice,
            combined with the moisture from the topping, that helps to adhere
            the strip of raw fish to the mound of rice underneath.

          <h3>What Is Gunkan Sushi?</h3>
          <p>
            “Gunkan” means “Mothership” and consists of a small ball of rice
            wrapped in a thin band of dry seaweed and topped with various
            ingredients. Looking like a warship, gunkan can be served as gunkan
            sushi or sometimes also called gunkan maki. Nonetheless, it is a
            popular form of Japanese cuisine consisting of the basic ingredients
            – rice and nori seaweed accompanied by small pieces of salmon, sea
            urchin or flying fish roe as the ingredients. Sushi Gunkan is
            usually served as 2 pieces per package. The filling of the gunkan is
            not always seafood. It can also be vegetables such as corn, cucumber
            and carrots.

          <p>
            Nori-maki is a handy, easy-to-eat sushi roll. A sheet of roasted
            nori seaweed is tightly wrapped around rice and fillings, such as
            fish or vegetables. Basically, there are two types of nori-maki:
            hoso-maki, thin rolls with a single filling; and futo-maki, thicker
            rolls with several fillings.
