            <h3>Nigiri</h3>
            <p>
              Nigiri sushi is that familiar style of sushi made up of an
              oval-shaped mound of rice with a slice of (usually) raw fish on
              top. The word nigiri comes from the Japanese nigirizushi, which
              translates as "hand-pressed sushi." Thus nigiri is a type of sushi
              where the rice is molded by hand and the fish or other topping
              pressed by hand atop the rice. And it's the stickiness of the
              rice, combined with the moisture from the topping.

            <h3>Gunkan</h3>
            <p>
              “Gunkan” means “Mothership” and consists of a small ball of rice
              wrapped in a thin band of dry seaweed and topped with various
              ingredients. Looking like a warship, gunkan can be served as
              gunkan sushi or sometimes also called gunkan maki. Nonetheless, it
              is a popular form of Japanese cuisine consisting of the basic
              ingredients – rice and nori seaweed accompanied by small pieces of
              salmon, sea urchin or flying fish roe as the ingredients. Sushi
              Gunkan is usually served as 2 pieces per package. The filling of
              the gunkan is not always seafood. It can also be vegetables such
              as corn, cucumber and carrots.

            <h3>Norimaki</h3>
            <p>
              Nori-maki is a handy, easy-to-eat sushi roll. A sheet of roasted
              nori seaweed is tightly wrapped around rice and fillings, such as
              fish or vegetables. Basically, there are two types of nori-maki:
              hoso-maki, thin rolls with a single filling; and futo-maki,
              thicker rolls with several fillings.
